**Timber: Fell Your Logs Fast** - A lightning-fast CLI log analysis tool built in Rust.

## 📋 Overview

Timber is a log-agnostic CLI tool that chops through noise to deliver patterns, trends, and stats from your logs. It's designed to be portable, requiring no servers or complex setup, and works with logs from any source—Java, Rust, Python, or any text-based logs.

## ✨ Features

- **Fast Pattern Search**: Find matches with regex support
- **Log Level Filtering**: Focus on specific severity levels (ERROR, WARN, INFO, etc.)
- **Time-based Trend Analysis**: See how log patterns change over time
- **Statistical Summaries**: Get insights on log levels, error types, and message uniqueness
- **Efficient Processing**: Handles large log files with minimal resource usage

## 🚀 Installation

### Cargo (Recommended)
```bash
cargo install timber-rs
```

### From Source
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/donaldc24/timber.git
cd timber

# Build with Cargo
cargo build --release

# Install locally
cargo install --path .
```

## 🔨 Usage

```bash
# Basic usage
timber path/to/logfile.log

# Search for a specific pattern
timber --chop "Exception" path/to/logfile.log

# Filter by log level
timber --level ERROR path/to/logfile.log

# Show time-based trends
timber --trend path/to/logfile.log

# Display statistical summary
timber --stats path/to/logfile.log

# Combine options
timber --chop "timeout" --level ERROR --trend --stats path/to/logfile.log
```

### Command-Line Options
